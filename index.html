      <p>This homemade pumpkin pie made with mashed, cooked pumpkin is my family's favorite. Skip the canned pumpkin and store-bought crust and make your holiday pumpkin pie from scratch with a flaky  homemade pastry crust and a deliciously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family  does! </p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>Pastry Crust:</ul>
          <li> 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour </li>
          <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
          <li>½ cup cold butter or shortening </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
     <br>
     <ul>filling:</ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin </li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
     <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol></ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
       <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender  until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is  moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed</li>
       <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a  thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut  a circle of dough 1 ½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set  pie pan aside</li>
       <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan.  Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top  edges</li>
       <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger,  nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared  crust. </li>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out  clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling  cooks.</li>
       <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving</li>
     <h2>To Prepare Mashed Pumpkin:</h2>
     <ul></ul>
      <li>Cut a fresh pie pumpkin in half. Scoop out and discard seeds and stringy portions. Leave skin on and cut  pumpkin into chunks. Measure out 1 ½ pounds for this recipe to yield 2 cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin.  If your pumpkin is larger, consider cooking 3 pounds and doubling the pie recipe above to make two pies.</li>
      <li>Place pumpkin chunks in saucepan over medium heat with 1 inch water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat  to low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove and discard peel.  Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill until smooth.</li>
